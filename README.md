This was literally the first time I ever tried making a game. I keep it up to remind me of where I started.

The idea was simple. A C++ blackjack game using SFML for rendering my cards and board to the screen. I got about as far as you'd expect. I was able to "hit" and I was able to display the cards. I had some pretty... questionable ideas about how to actually develop the game loop.

One day I may return to this. One day.
